# Binary Challenge Solo Project
The primary goal of this solo project is to gain a deeper understanding of Cypress testing and the usage of Class/Functional Components.
This Application was created to solve the problem of "Turning Cat people into Dog people", I chose this problem as a way to create something 
fun and light hearted while still solving an issue. The project was built using React, React Router and Cypress to gain a deeper understanding of the ins and outs of creating a react app that is fully tested (happy/sad path) with Cypress.

## Project Description
The complete project spec and rubric can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/binary-challenge.html).

  1. Run `npm install` to compile the React application.
  1. Run `npm install cypress --save-dev` to install Cypress.
  1. Run `npm start` to see the app running locally.
  1. Run `<your text editor> .` to see the code in your text editor.
  1. Run `npm test` to see all of the tests running in your Terminal.
